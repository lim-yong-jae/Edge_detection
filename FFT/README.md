# Fast Fourier transform
I think the thing should satisfy somethings for being called "transform".
1) If transform is defined, inverse transform should be defined too.
2) Original signal and transformed signal should have one to one correspondence.
3) The transformed signal should be back to original signal by inverse transformed.

For example, Fourier transform, it satisfy all condition described above. It's mathematical properties is not considered for judging that it is "transform" or not.

Fast Frouier transform also should satisfy these conditions for called transformed. And its mathematical properties is other one. But fast fourier transform's goal is to maintain Fourier transform's mathematical properties and modify some point of fourier transform for being used in computer. So it defined as

Y(k) is the fast fourier transformed results and, X is the original signal
